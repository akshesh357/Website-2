           <p style="color:white;width:75%">Snooker in its modern form originated in the latter half of the 19th century.
		   Billiards had been a popular activity amongst British Army officers stationed in India, and variations
		   on the more traditional billiard games were devised. One variation, devised in the officers' mess in Jabalpur
		   during 1874 or 1875,[8] was to add coloured balls in addition to the reds and black which were used for pyramid pool and life pool.</p>
